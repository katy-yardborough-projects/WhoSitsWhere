# WhoSitsWhere

#####Overview
Created as a project to solve the issue of not being able to locate members of staff in an office, which is particularly useful for new starters. It leverages Active Directory for information gathering and automatically plots the results on an office plan.

#####Running the tool
You can either download a release, which should run immediately on any Windows machine with .NET installed. Or you can clone the repository and build the source using Visual Studio.

Once running, configure the output directory and hit 'find seating positions'.
